To compile and run my game do the following:-

1. Open the visual studio developer command prompt.
2. Use "cd" and enter the directory where the game is saved.
	so for me it was "cd C:\Users\lharp\Documents\set08122"
3. Use "cl c4.c" to compile the game.
4. Now enter "c4" and the game will launch in the console.
5. Now the game is playable with instructions in game.
